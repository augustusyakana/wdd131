            <h2>Golden Retriever Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Golden Retrievers are natural swimmers! Their water-repellent coats and webbed feet make
                them excellent at
                retrieving from lakes and rivers — hence the name!</p>

            <h2>Beagle Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Beagles have over 220 million scent receptors in their noses (humans have about 5 million),
                which makes
                them scent-tracking pros. This is why they're often used at airports to sniff out contraband!</p>

            <h2>Corgi Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Corgis were bred to herd cattle — those little legs are fast and nimble enough to nip at cow
                ankles and
                dodge kicks. Also, their short stature helps them duck under hooves!</p>

            <h2>Dachshund Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Dachshunds were originally bred to hunt badgers! Their name in German literally means
                “badger dog,” and
                their long, narrow bodies helped them burrow into badger dens.</p>

            <h2>Boston Terrier Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Known as the “American Gentleman,” Boston Terriers were the first dog breed developed in the
                United States.
                Their tuxedo-like coat and polite manners earned them the nickname.</p>

            <h2>Tricolor Beagle Puppy</h2>
            <p>🐾 Fun Fact: Beagles love company! They're pack animals and tend to do best in environments where they
                can be around
                other dogs or humans. A lonely Beagle will likely get creative (and a little mischievous) to keep
                entertained.</p>
